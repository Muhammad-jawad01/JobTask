Got it! Below is the updated `README.md` for your PHP-based project without the Laravel-specific sections. I have also included the required instructions for setting up PHP with a MySQL database and handling email configuration manually:

```markdown
# JobTask Project

## Description
This project is a user dashboard system that displays registered users and allows for user management. It includes authentication, a list of registered users, and basic features like user editing and logging out.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:
- PHP (version 7.4 or higher)
- MySQL (or any compatible database)
- Composer (for managing PHP dependencies)
- Apache or Nginx (for serving the application)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-jawad01/JobTask.git
```

### 2. Create a Database

Create a new database for the project in your MySQL server. You can do this by logging into MySQL and running the following command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE jobtask_db;
```

### 3. Configure Database Connection

In the project folder, there is a `connection.php` file where the database connection is established. Open `connection.php` and ensure that the database connection settings are correctly configured as follows:

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";  // Database host
$username = "root";         // Database username
$password = "";             // Database password (if applicable)
$dbname = "jobtask_db";     // The name of your database

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
```

### 4. Set Up Email Configuration

If your project uses email functionality (e.g., for password resets or notifications), configure your email settings in the `.env` file or directly within your PHP files, depending on how the email feature is implemented.

If your PHP project is sending emails, you'll typically need an SMTP server to send those emails. Below are configurations for common email providers.

#### Example email configuration for PHP:

You can use **PHPMailer** for sending emails. Here's an example of how to set it up:

```php
<?php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';  // Assuming PHPMailer is installed via Composer

$mail = new PHPMailer(true);
try {
    //Server settings
    $mail->isSMTP();
    $mail->Host = 'smtp.mailtrap.io';  // Change to your email provider's SMTP host
    $mail->SMTPAuth = true;
    $mail->Username = 'your_mailtrap_username';  // Your SMTP username
    $mail->Password = 'your_mailtrap_password';  // Your SMTP password
    $mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_STARTTLS;
    $mail->Port = 2525;

    //Recipients
    $mail->setFrom('from@example.com', 'Mailer');
    $mail->addAddress('recipient@example.com', 'Joe User');  // Add a recipient

    // Content
    $mail->isHTML(true);
    $mail->Subject = 'Here is the subject';
    $mail->Body    = 'This is the HTML message body <b>in bold!</b>';

    $mail->send();
    echo 'Message has been sent';
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Message could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}";
}
?>
```

Make sure to replace the SMTP configuration with the one provided by your email service provider (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid, etc.).

### 5. Start the Server

Once everything is configured, start the development server using the following command:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

### 6. Access the Application

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Email Configuration Requirements

To enable email functionality, ensure that you have the following:
- SMTP server details (such as from Mailtrap, Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)
- Email credentials (username and password or API key)
- Set the appropriate email configurations in the PHP email script.

### Common Issues and Troubleshooting

1. **Error: "Unable to connect to SMTP server"**
   - Make sure the SMTP host and port are correctly configured.
   - Check if your firewall or network settings are blocking the connection.

2. **Error: "Authentication Failed"**
   - Verify that your email credentials (username and password or API key) are correct.
   - If using Gmail, you might need to enable "Less secure apps" or use OAuth for authentication.

3. **Error: "Failed to send email"**
   - Check the email sending queue or error logs for more details.
   - Make sure your email service provider allows sending emails from your domain.
